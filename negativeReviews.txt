A very very very slow-moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man.  
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out.  
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  
Very little music or anything to speak of.  
The rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning... If it's about emptiness it works I guess because it's empty.  
Wasted two hours.  
A bit predictable.  
It had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  
The problem was the script.  
It was horrendous.  
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
Frankly after Cotton club and Unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film because it is BAD.  
The acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  
It was too predictable even for a chick flick.  
Too politically correct.  
Very disappointing.  
I love Lane but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
The movie was so boring that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  
) and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  
The directing seems too pretentious.  
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror really stupid.  
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  
However this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie.  
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  
All in all a great disappointment.  
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  
Unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
It is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  
You can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them.  
This movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen it confuses you incredibly.  
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
A truly truly bad film.  
The acting is terrible and the writing is worse.  
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  
I paid too much.  
It was so BORING!  
No plot whatsoever!  
Again no plot at all.  
Horrible!  
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
I hate movies like that.  
Yeah the movie pretty much sucked.  
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
If you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
Awful.  
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  
This is a bad film with bad writing and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
Crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
I mean this in a terrible way.  
This film has no redeeming features.  
Everything is appalling.  
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i.e.  
The story is beyond stupid.  
The script isÂ…was there a script?  
The kids are annoying.  
The lead man is charisma-free.  
Utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture.  
I'll even say it again Â– this is torture.  
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
Highly unrecommended.  
If this premise sound stupid that's because it is.  
Yes it's that bad.  
Nothing at all to recommend.  
This movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense.  
There were too many close ups.  
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the Slavic female character was just too much.  
It's just lame.  
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
Everything about this movie is stupid.  
Even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie.  
It is shameful.  
The new characters weren't all that memorable and I found myself forgetting who was who.  
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  
It didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid.  
If you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  
God and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  
Unfortunately 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  
I couldn't take them seriously.  
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  
Even worse than Ticker!  
& That movie was bad.  
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations MAYBE & poor hummh!  
It just blew.  
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere.  
Almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round.  
I wish I could enter negative values admins?  
The sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here) no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  
Oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too.  
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former) the dialog chimp-like and the camera work barely tolerable.  
Yes I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation.  
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance.  
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea we both hated it.  
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines.  
The acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  
Wow what a bad film.  
Not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible.  
The plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling.  
Not even good for camp value!  
I wasn't expecting Oscar material but this?  
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  
This gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower.  
This is one I did not have but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed.  
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script.  
Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  
Whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely.  
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  
Even the squibs look awful.  
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  
The plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all.  
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush almost always in Olde English and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  
The directing is sloppy at best.  
Hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing.  
Of course the acting is blah.  
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
And FINALLY after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning.  
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
By the time the film ended I not only disliked it I despised it.  
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
Things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  
Everything about it is just bad.  
I could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
The script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  
The casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors period.  
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  
It is zillion times away from reality.  
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  
there is no real plot.  
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  
So bad...well...it's just bad.  
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way.  
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
I thought it was bad.  
Both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable.  
Let's start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad.  
The script is a big flawed mess.  
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
Director Paul Matthews who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim" clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  
The movie is terribly boring in places.  
The lighting is awful.  
The film looks cheap and bland.  
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
This convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here.  
The visual effects were AWFUL.  
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  
To sum the film up "Breeders" is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  
Not recommended.  
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing.  
Aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits.  
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer.  
The budget was evidently very limited.  
This was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below-par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
However here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up.  
Filmiing was less expansive.  
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
Not recommended.  
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
Even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep.  
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash -period!  
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  
Every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well... talk.  
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  
To be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  
In conclusion I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  
The story line is just awful!  
It's just painful!  
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
Omit watching this.  
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
Regardless the film fails on most levels.  
Avoid at all costs.  
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but George was well dull.  
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests.  
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created.  
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  
The least said about the acting the better.  
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series) this is baaaaaad.  
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work you can skip this one.  
It is not good.  
Speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
Then the film just dropped the ball.  
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
It's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time.  
It is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  
How awful she is!  
But she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  
The results well are a shame.  
DELETE this film from your mind!  
One of the worst shows of all time.  
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  
The fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad-ass girl who are these actors???  
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
Im big fan of RPG games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  
The lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong.  
You can find better movies at youtube.  
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes.  
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.  
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  
It's an empty hollow shell of a movie.  
Seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on.  
Avoid avoid avoid!  
It will drive you barking mad!  
Nothing new there.  
That was done in the second movie.  
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
And it was boring.  
I am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast.  
Why was this film made?  
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  
The result is a film that just don't look right.  
None of them are engaging or exciting.  
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc...it's ALL wrong.  
In fact this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  
Avoid at ALL costs!  
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
The worst one of the series.  
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  
It's very slow.  
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  
) Don't waste your time.  
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  
Otherwise don't even waste your time on this.  
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  
As for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  
One of the most boringpointless movies I have ever seen.  
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
Hated it.  
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie!  
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
This is not movie-making.  
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is.  
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  
I agree with Jessica this movie is pretty bad.  
Characters are one-dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  
The story line is totally predictable.  
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
Bad characters bad story and bad acting.  
Really awful.  
Not easy to watch.  
Just whatever you do avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
If you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon) and this one fails everywhere.  
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
Instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting.  
I never walked out of a movie faster.  
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  
Unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  
In a word it is embarrassing.  
Exceptionally bad!  
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.
